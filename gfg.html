        <summary class ='d'>DHURKESH</summary>
        <p>The name Dhurkesh is a masculine (boy) name that likely has roots in Indian or Sanskrit origins. However, it's a relatively uncommon or modern name, so direct meanings from classical texts may not always be available. Still, we can try to break it down:
        </p>
        <h1>Possible Breakdown:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>"Dhur"</strong>  or <strong>"Dhura"</strong>  (धुर) in Sanskrit can mean "burden," "responsibility," or "yoke" (as in something that holds or bears weight, like leadership).</li>
            <li><strong> "Kesh"</strong> (केश) commonly means "hair" in Sanskrit, but in names like Ramesh, Mukesh, Rajesh, it acts more like a suffix implying "lord" or "ruler." It comes from "Ish", meaning "lord" or "god.".</li>
        <h1>So, Dhurkesh might mean:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>"One who bears great responsibility"</li>
            <li>"Leader or ruler with strength""</li>
            <li>"One who carries the burden of leadership"</li>
        </ul>
